# Count Buffy 🧛‍♀️

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

#### Update submodules

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Pull the 🧛‍♀️ Image

```shell
docker compose pull
```

### Hello World Example

The `examples` directory includes a simple example of using 🧛‍♀️ to
model a rate-limiter scheduler and verify certain workload and queries.

```shell
docker compose run --rm buffy hello-world
```

### Run Experiments

For performance evaluation of 🧛‍♀️ we used the 4 case studies used
in FPerf.
For each case study, we run the FPerf search for various buffers sizes
and recorded all workloads generated during the search.
Then we checked these workloads using 🧛‍♀️ to first ensure that we get the
same SAT/UNSAT result and also compare the time of each call to the backend
verification engine.
This way we can compare the efficiency of 🧛‍♀️'s model against FPerf.

Data for our experimental results include:

- Workloads generated by FPerf
- Verification time of these workloads in 🧛‍♀️
- Charts to compare the verification time of 🧛‍♀️ and FPerf

To reproduce the result claimed in the paper, we provide 4 levels:

1. Generate charts from the existing output of 🧛‍♀️ and FPerf
2. Verify each workload in 🧛‍♀️ and generate the timing
3. Check each workload in FPerf
4. Generate the workloads using FPerf search

### 1- Generate Charts

- `data/sub_logs` includes the output of 🧛‍♀️ (logs generated for submission)
- `data/sub_wls` includes the output of FPerf that we already

```shell
docker compose run --rm -e BUFFY_LOGS_DIR=data/sub_logs buffy draw_all_charts.sh
```

Charts are saved in the `data/charts` directory.

> Here we are using previously generated data used for the submission (`data/sub_logs` and `data/sub_wls`)

### 2- Verify Workloads in 🧛‍♀️

- `data/logs` includes the output of 🧛‍♀️ (new logs that you generate)
  generated and stored here

Clear existing log files:

```shell
rm -rf data/logs data/charts
```

Verify all workloads in 🧛‍♀️:

```shell
docker compose run --rm buffy run_all_experiments.sh
```

draw the charts again:

```shell
docker compose run --rm buffy draw_all_charts.sh
```

### 3- Check Workloads in FPerf

Check workloads in FPerf:

```shell
docker compose run --rm buffy check_all_workloads_with_fperf.sh
```

### 4- Generate Workloads in FPerf

Generate workloads of FPerf during the search:

```shell
docker compose run --rm buffy run_all_fperf.sh
```

FPerf new workloads are saved into the `data/new_wls` directory.

Verify newly generated workloads in 🧛‍♀️:

```shell
docker compose run --rm -e BUFFY_WLS_DIR=data/new_wls buffy run_all_experiments.sh
```

draw the charts again:

```shell
docker compose run --rm -e BUFFY_WLS_DIR=data/new_wls buffy draw_all_charts.sh
```
